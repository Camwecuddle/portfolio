  <p>The movie "Scott Pilgrim vs The World" is my favorite movie of all time. After watching it two or three times you start to pick up on all the cool details that the dirctor put in. One of my favorite details is the T-shirt design for each character. That's where Astro Boy's face comes from. </p>
