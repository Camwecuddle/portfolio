        <p class="inner-text">These are a couple of minimalist desktop backgrounds that I made during my freshman year of college. The goldfish was inspired by the app that I was helping design at the time, and the red panda is my favorite animal. The pixel city is one of my first experiments with pixel art. The next one is a megaman themed background and I like megaman's character design.</p>

        <p class="inner-text">Video games have been a hobby of mine for as long as I can remember. I started out with the Nintendo 64 and have since progressed all the way to the Nintendo Switch. But my favorite console is the Game Cube and I was inspired to design a poster with images taken from each one.</p>

        <p class="inner-text">Logo design is a career path that has always intruiged me. A logo is an icon that can represent an entire company. Apple's apple for example is a world renown logo that seems so simple yet so cleverly created if you know what to look for. I want to use my creativity to design clever and beautiful logos.</p>
